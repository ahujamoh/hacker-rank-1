These are Renzo Carbonara's Haskell solutions to some programming
challenges from [HackerRank](https://www.hackerrank.com).

# How to install

Using `cabal-dev`:

    cabal-dev install --enable-test
    ./cabal-dev/bin/hr

That will print to standard output the list of challenge solutions
available. Pick one, say `saveprincess`, and run it as:

    ./cabal-dev/bin/hr saveprincess
